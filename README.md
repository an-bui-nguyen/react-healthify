* Seamless browsing using React Redux to manage user's information and queried data during a browser's session.
* SPA routing using the `react-router-dom` library.
* A NodeJS backend to serve minified frontend React files.
* Docker containerization for deployment to Fly.io.
* RESTful API requests to [MyHealthFinder](https://health.gov/our-work/national-health-initiatives/health-literacy/consumer-health-content/free-web-content/apis-developers) to retrieve health data.
* Modern styling and responsive web development using Flexbox, Boostrap, and Material UI.
